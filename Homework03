-- Question 1
-- Write a function that checks if the monthly consumption of an electrical device is bigger, equal, or smaller than the maximum allowed and
-- returns a message accordingly. 
-- The function has to take the hourly consumption of an electrical device, the hours of daily use, and the maximum monthly consumption allowed.
-- (Monthly usage = consumption (kW) * hours of daily use (h) * 30 days).

checkFunction:: Float -> Float -> String 
checkFunction consumption hours 
| monthly > allowed = "The monthly consumption of an electrical device is bigger than the maximum allowed"
| monthly < allowed = "The monthly consumption of an electrical device is smaller than the maximum allowed"
| otherwise = "The monthly consumption of an electrical device is equal the maximum allowed"
where 
  monthly =  consumption * hours * 30
  allowed = 100

-- Question 2
-- Prelude:
-- We use the function `show :: a -> String` to transform any type into a String.
-- So `show 3` will produce `"3"` and `show (3 > 2)` will produce `"True"`.

-- In the previous function, return the excess/savings of consumption as part of the message.


-- Question 3
-- Write a function that showcases the advantages of using let expressions to split a big expression into smaller ones.
-- Then, share it with other students in Canvas.
